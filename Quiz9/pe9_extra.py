def generate_path(maze, N, M):
    # This function generates a random path through an NxM maze, represented as a dictionary. The keys are (i, j) tuples representing
    # coordinates of each cell in the maze and the values are integers: 0 for empty, 1 for obstacle, and 2 for path. The path starts 
    # from (0,0) and ends at (N-1,M-1), and the direction (right or down) at each step is chosen randomly.

    # your code here


def add_obstacles(maze, min_obstacles, N, M):
    # This function randomly adds obstacles (represented as 1) to the empty cells (represented as 0) in the given maze until at least
    # min_obstacles have been added. If a KeyError occurs while trying to set an obstacle, it is caught and a message is printed.

    # your code here
    

def set_obstacle(maze, N, M):
    # This function allows a user to manually set an obstacle in the maze. The user is prompted to input the coordinates of the cell
    # where they want to place the obstacle. If the cell is part of the path or an obstacle is already present, an error message is 
    # displayed. If the coordinates are out of bounds or not integers, a KeyError or ValueError is raised, respectively.

    # your code here


def remove_obstacle(maze, N, M):
    # This function allows a user to manually remove an obstacle from the maze. The user is prompted to input the coordinates of the 
    # cell where they want to remove the obstacle. If the cell is part of the path or there's no obstacle at the given cell, an error 
    # message is displayed. If the coordinates are out of bounds or not integers, a KeyError or ValueError is raised, respectively.

    # your code here


def print_maze(maze, N, M):
    # This function prints the current state of the maze in a grid-like format. Each cell is represented by a 3-character string: 
    # '   ' for empty cells, ' X ' for obstacles, and ' O ' for path cells.

    # your code here


def main():
    # This function serves as the main driver of the program. It reads the maze dimensions from a file, asks the user for the minimum 
    # number of obstacles to be added, generates the path and adds the obstacles, and then enters a loop where the user can choose to 
    # set or remove obstacles, print the maze, or exit the program. Exceptions for ValueError, IOError, and NameError are handled.

    # your code here
    # load grid
